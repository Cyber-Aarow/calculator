# calculator

This is a project assigned by The Odin Project in order to combine all my lessons on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I chose to model it after the iOS calculator (particularly, the iPhone version), having it perform the same, with slight modifications (a '%' button seems useless to me, so I opted for '^' as its replacement).

I did accidentally make it while zoomed in 400%, so bear that in mind and set your Zoom accordingly.
